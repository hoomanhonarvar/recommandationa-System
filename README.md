## General Information
- Creating a recommendation system for user_movie rating problem using SVD without any pre-built functions in python.
- providing prediction of favorite unseen movies for each user. In addition, it can be expanded for other purposes too.
- it has built for linear algebra project.
- SVD is a powerful technique used in recommender systems to make personalized recommendations to users. By breaking down the user-item matrix into its core component, SVD allows us to find latent representations of users and items .



## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.10

## Usage
It can be used in websites and applications in AI part in backend for faster and better user application. 



## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- adding accuracy calculating feature 
- adding gathering and clustering with SVD for movies or users
